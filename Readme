This project consist of 2 programs: the server and the client
I've implemented an applicaton protocol, which facilitate all the communications
between the client andd the server.
The client is connected to the server using TCP. When a clients connects, it must
provide the server an unique ID. This client can subscribe to a topic and unsubscribe
The server also comunicates with some UDP clients, who will send a message for
a specific topic. The TCP clients subscribed to that topic will receive that
message.
